# REMAKE THIS IN JS
# This is just establishing the script idea
# ADD: TKINTER

# enter 4 names
# pull initials, store in a list of tuples

# find every arrangement of those letters
# using loops? inefficient, but works for now

# let user select which dictionary to use
# search the dictionary file using these rules
# letters must occur in the order they're shown
# W <-> U, K -> C
# maybe work backwards? 
# >> find any word with all of those letters, then arrange the letter.
